    "In this notebook, a recommender system is created based on the space embeddings obtained from the discrete space embeddings model. The purpose of the recommender system is to recommend areas in either London or New York based on a user's experience in either of the cities. The recommender system will make recommendations based on space embeddings for an area weighted by the average rating a user has given to establishments in the area. The similarity between embeddings is calculated using cosine similarity, where only areas with cosine similarity above 0.5 are considered valid recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommender system is hosted as an API through the AI platform Grace by 2021.ai. The API receives establishment IDs and corresponding ratings as inputs, returning cosine similarity for all areas in the city the user has no experience in. The areas that are considered valid recommendations are visualized on a map and colored according to their calculated similarity. To demonstrate how the API works and to assess the quality of the recommendations obtained, the recommender system is tested on three personas with different preferences. "

To use the recommender system, a post request has to be made for the API, which the recommender system is deployed on.

The recommender system takes `x` and `feature_names` as input, where the former is a matrix containing establishment IDs and their corresponding user given ratings and the latter are the feature names `IDs` and `Rating`. Firstly, some data manipulations are completed to calculate the average embedding of the user. Afterward, the cosine similarity between the average embedding of the user and the embeddings for the other city are calculated. The recommender system then returns a sorted data frame of the cosine similarity for each area in the other city than provided in the input `x`."
